## Description

This profile generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username provided by the user. 

When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.
